**Locked Me - Virtual Key for Repositories**

- Simple Java Console based program to allows user to input menu options for (i)displaying File/Folder structure.                                                                (ii)Search for File/Folder recursively.                                                            (iii)Add/Delete File/Folder recursively. 
- **View project locally**: to try out the project in your local machine:          (i)clone this repository using git clone.                                                     (ii)Open the folder from Eclipse/IntelliJ                                                                     (iii)Open Main.java and run the program using Main.java.                                                                       
- **Main.java**: This component contains the Main method. It's the entry point of the program. 
- **WelcomeMenu.java**: This component contains displaying menu options & methods for handling different options from user input and calls respective methods from FileHandlingOperations. 
- **FileHandlingOperations.java**: This component defines all the operations required for displaying, searching, deleting and adding files/folder. To track below deliverables -

Java concepts being used in the project

Data Structures where sorting and searching techniques are used.

Generic features and operations available:

1. Retrieving the file names in an ascending order
1. Business-level operations:

Option to add a user specified file to the application

Option to delete a user specified file from the application

Option to search a user specified file from the application

Navigation option to close the current execution context and return to the main context

1. Option to close the application Code designed to display the welcome screen. It displays:

Application name and the developer details

The details of the user interface such as options displaying the user interaction information

Features to accept the user input to select one of the options listed

The first option returns the current file names in ascending order. The root directory can be either empty or contain few files or folders in it.

The second option returns the details of the user interface such as options displaying the following:

Add a file to the existing directory list

Delete a user specified file from the existing directory list

Search a user specified file from the main directory

Option to navigate back to the main context

There is a third option to close the application.

Implemented the concepts such as exceptions, collections, and sorting techniques for source code optimization and increased performance
